# Real-Time Chat Room

This is a simple real-time chat room web application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. The project demonstrates a basic yet effective way to implement bi-directional communication between multiple clients through WebSockets. The backend uses Express to serve static files and manage WebSocket connections using Socket.IO, while the frontend offers a minimal chat UI built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Users can type messages, send them via a button or by pressing Enter, and instantly see them appear in the chat window. The entire communication is handled live, with no page refreshes required, providing a smooth and instant messaging experience.
